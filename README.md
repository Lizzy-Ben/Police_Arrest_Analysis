# Police Arrest Data Analysis
- A Full Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python
## Project Overview
- This project explores a real-world police arrest dataset to identify patterns in arrest frequency across demographic groups, locations, time periods and police units.
It applies end-to-end data analysis techniques — from cleaning and transformation to visualization and insights using Python and Plotly Express.
- The goal is to understand when, where, and to whom arrests occur most frequently and to develop insights that can support operational planning and public safety decision-making.
## Objectives
- Examine arrest patterns across gender, ethnicity, and race
- Identify the bureau and division with the highest arrests
- Analyze arrests by time of day, month, year, and Month-Year
- Determine the specific Month-Year with the highest and lowest arrest counts
- Create interactive visualizations using Plotly Express
- Apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
